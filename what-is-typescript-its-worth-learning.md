<h3><strong>What is Typescript ?</strong></h3>
<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank"><strong>TypeScript</strong> </a>is a free and open-source programming language created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg" target="_blank"><strong>Anders Hejlsberg</strong></a>, the creator of Turbo Pascal, Delphi, C#, and maintained by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank"><strong>Microsoft</strong></a>.

<strong>TypeScript</strong> isn’t a completely new language, it’s a superset of ES6. If we write ES6 code, it’s perfectly valid and compilable TypeScript code. Here’s a diagram that shows the relationship between the languages:

What is <strong>ES5</strong>? What is <strong>ES6</strong>? ES5 is short for <strong>“<a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/" target="_blank">ECMAScript 5</a>”</strong>, otherwise known as “regular <strong>Javascript</strong>”. ES5 is the <strong>normal Javascript</strong>. It runs in more-or-less every browser. <strong>ES6</strong> is the <strong>next</strong> version of Javascript.

Also, we can mention that TypeScript is an official collaboration between <strong>Microsoft</strong> and <strong>Google</strong>
<h3><strong>It's worth learning ?</strong></h3>
With two tech heavyweights ( <strong>Microsoft</strong> and <strong>Google</strong>) behind it we know that it will be supported for a long time. Both groups are committed to moving the web forward and as developers we win because of it.

Also <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank"><strong>Angular2</strong> </a>is built in TypeScript and there are a lot of reasons to use TypeScript instead of plain Javascript

How do you think ? it's worth learning ?
